# 📊 S&P 500 Stock Forecasting Dashboard

## 🚀 Introduction
The S&P 500 Stock Forecasting & Insights Dashboard is a complete end-to-end data pipeline and visualization platform designed to deliver stock insights, forecasts, and financial metrics for companies in the S&P 500 index.
This project automates the ETL pipeline (Extract → Transform → Load), generates time-series forecasts using machine learning, and provides an interactive dashboard for exploring stock performance, technical indicators, fundamentals, and predictions.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- End-to-end pipeline from data ingestion → processing → forecasting → dashboard.
- Technical + fundamental analysis combined in one platform.
- 7-day Prophet forecasts with confidence intervals.
- Dockerized deployment with GitHub Actions for continuous integration.

## Setup & Installation
Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/VatsalSangani/S-P500_stock_forecasting_dashboard.git
cd S-P500_stock_forecasting_dashboard
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

Install Dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements_dashboard.txt
```

Run the dashboard locally:
```
streamlit run app/app.py
```

---

## ☁️ Deployment
- Data Pipeline: Local ETL + Prophet forecasting → upload processed + forecast data to AWS S3.
- Sync Script: EC2 instance uses scripts/sync_s3.sh to pull fresh data from S3.
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions automatically deploys updates to EC2 using Docker.
- Hosting: Streamlit dashboard runs in a container on EC2 (t3.micro) at port 8502.

---

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
- Automate weekly pipeline using Apache Airflow or AWS Lambda + EventBridge.
- Expand fundamentals with more financial ratios (ROE, Debt/Equity, etc.).
- Introduce user authentication for role-based dashboards (analyst vs manager).
- Optimize deployment using Kubernetes (k3s) + Terraform for production scaling.
